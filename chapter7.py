# # basically loops is just a repitioon of some blocks of code 
# loops is basically of two types :
# 1)for loop:- Thisloop  basically runs when we know how many times that the loop will run 
# example:---- for i in range(1,15): # yaha pe 15 exclude ho jayega just like indexing 
# print(i) #output:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

# 2) while loop:- This loop basically runs until one condition is meet or true we can say .
# example:---- i=1
# while (i<=10):
#         print(i)
#         i+=1    #output:1,2,3,5,5,6,7,8,9,10
